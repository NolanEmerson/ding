# Ding
# Meal planner for the indecisive

Ding is a full web-based meal planning application created by a team of four developers over a period of six weeks.
It utilizes PHP and a MySQL database on the back-end, and uses ReactJS mixed with Materialize and CSS3 on the front-end.

## Usage

Our application was created as an easy solution for the individual who wants to plan their meals but is too indecisive to make a choice.  All it takes is a few simple steps: register your account, select your diet and allergy restrictions, choose the number of meals you plan to make. Thats it! At your fingertips you have access to ingredients, nutrition and step-by-step instructions to make your delicious meals!
